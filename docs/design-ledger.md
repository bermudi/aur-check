# aur-safe — reviewer context

`aur-safe` is a deterministic gate for Arch Linux AUR package updates. This file
exists so reviewers give useful feedback instead of re-litigating decisions
that were deliberate. **Read this before reviewing the script.**

## What problem it solves (threat model)

aur-safe is a deterministic gate for Arch Linux AUR package updates — it
catches malicious updates **before** they reach pacman. See
**[threat-model.md](threat-model.md)** for the full, sourced account —
attacker profile, three-wave obfuscation timeline, homograph vector, and
related community tools. This document focuses on *design decisions*, not
threat narrative.

## Architecture (settled — don't propose alternatives unless you see a real flaw)

**Deterministic classification is the gate. The LLM cannot override risk.**

- yay/paru keep a per-package git clone (`~/.cache/yay/<pkg>` or
  `~/.cache/paru/clone/<pkg>`). Checked-out `HEAD` = last version you built
  (treated as known-good). `origin/master` = candidate.
- On update: `git fetch`, diff `HEAD..origin/master`, classify the ADDED lines
  plus changed-file structure.
- Hard-fail rules → exit 1, block the update.
- Deterministic boring metadata allowlist (version/pkgrel/pkgver, checksum-only,
  literal optional dependency metadata, same-host `source=()` changes, no
  structural signals) → exit 0.
- Boring-edge (same narrow fields, but parser-ambiguous formatting/array shape)
  → exit 2 unless `AUR_SAFE_LLM_AUTO_BORING=1` and the strict verifier returns
  exactly `VERDICT: BORING_EDGE_OK`.
- Review-only rules, structural signals, or audit-unavailable results → exit 2,
  warn but don't block.
- `explain` subcommand pipes a *flagged* diff to an LLM (`zai/glm-5.2` via
  `pi`, reusing existing auth) for a second opinion. Advisory only.

**LLM boundary:** the attacker is using obfuscated bash (hex/octal escapes).
LLMs handle obfuscated bash inconsistently — false negatives on the real attack,
false positives on legit updates. The LLM therefore cannot override hard,
review, audit-unavailable, clone/diff, staging, or accept decisions. The only
opt-in gate use is a narrow convenience verifier for deterministic
`boring_edge`: the diff already has no dangerous patterns, no review patterns,
no changed files outside `PKGBUILD`/`.SRCINFO`, no added/removed files, and no
new maintainer/source host domains. Anything except an exact first-line
`VERDICT: BORING_EDGE_OK` stays review.

**Why not a pacman hook:** pacman hooks run *after* install — by then the
malicious `.install` has already executed. Interception must happen before
makepkg/pacman, hence the shell wrapper around yay/paru.

## Decisions that look arbitrary but aren't

### `set -uo pipefail` without `set -e`
The script does many `grep ... || true` and explicit exit-code propagation
(`case $rc in 1) ...`). `set -e` would fight that pattern. Pipefail catches
the real dangers (silent grep failures in pipelines); `-e` would add noise.

### Single hex/octal escape → review; run of 2+ → hard-fail
The obvious "fix" is an ANSI-color-code whitelist (`\x1b`, `\033`). **Don't
propose this** — a name-list whitelist is itself an evasion surface. An
attacker sprinkles `\x1b` decoys to look legit, then hides the real payload
in the middle. The run-based heuristic is structural: obfuscation spells out
strings as *runs* of escapes; color codes are isolated. Cleaner distinction,
no maintainable list to poison.

### `audit` scans `PKGBUILD` + `*.install` + `*.sh`, not "all text files"
Scanning READMEs and LICENSEs would trip every rule (they legitimately
contain example shell snippets, escape sequences in docs). That's the alert
fatigue that defeats the whole tool. The sourced-script surface is the actual
attack surface.

### `${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}` is NOT used on the rule arrays
The `RULE_NAMES`/`RULE_PATTERNS` arrays are statically populated at the top of
the script — never empty, never unset. The `set -u` guard is cargo cult on
bash 5 for arrays that provably cannot be empty. **It IS used in the wrapper's
`_pkgs` array**, where emptiness is a real runtime possibility. Don't suggest
applying it uniformly.

### `git fetch` failure → warn and continue, not fail-closed
If fetch fails (offline, AUR down), we diff against whatever `origin/master`
is locally cached — which is the last successful fetch, still a valid
known-good baseline. Failing closed would block all updates during routine
network blips, training users to ignore warnings.

### Accepted-ref state (finding 1.2) — the trust-anchor fix

**Problem:** `check_pkg` used to diff `HEAD..origin/master`, trusting the
helper-cache HEAD as known-good. But HEAD can advance past the known-good state
(aborted build, manual `git pull` in the cache, helper restart) → an empty diff
prints clean while a malicious update lands.

**Design (staging + post-build accept):**
- `accepted/<pkgbase>` = `<sha>\t<iso-utc>\t<origin-url>`. Seeded from cache HEAD
  on first contact, then frozen.
- On a clean or review-only audit, `check_pkg` writes the **gate-time**
  `origin/master` tip to `staged/<pkgbase>` (NOT on empty-diff / hard-fail /
  skip paths) and appends `pkgbase` to a per-run manifest (`last-gate`).
- The wrapper captures the helper's exit code, runs the build, then calls
  `aur-safe accept`. `accept` promotes `staged → accepted` **only for manifest
  entries pacman confirms installed at the staged version**.

**Why staging (not deferred acceptance or post-build bump):** the accepted ref
must mean *the commit we audited*, not *what got installed*. There's a TOCTOU
window between `check_pkg`'s fetch and the helper's own fetch. Capturing the
gate-time tip (X) means a window-commit X′ lands installed-but-not-accepted;
the next gate diffs X..origin/master, surfaces X′ as fresh delta, audits it.
Deferred acceptance (match installed pkgver vs `.SRCINFO`) was rejected: needs a
new parser and pkgver can stay identical across a malicious push.

**Install-confirmation assertion (closes the untested `-Syu` partial-failure
case):** `accept` compares the installed version (`pacman -Q`) against the
staged commit's `.SRCINFO` pkgver/pkgrel/epoch — ANY matching pkgname counts
(for split packages). The `.SRCINFO` format (verified against makepkg source +
real cached files): `pkgbase=` and `pkgname=` are section headers at column 0
(no leading tab); attributes are tab-indented; a blank line separates sections.
makepkg always emits `pkgname=` (one per sub-package, even for non-split where
it equals pkgbase). A defensive `pkgbase=` fallback covers malformed files
missing `pkgname=`:

```
names=$(awk -F' = ' '/^[[:space:]]*pkgname =/ {print $2}' <<<"$srcinfo")
  [[ -n "$names" ]] || names=$(awk -F' = ' '/^[[:space:]]*pkgbase =/ {print $2; exit}' <<<"$srcinfo")
```
Note the `^[[:space:]]*` (not `^\t`): well-formed files indent attributes with
a single tab, but some real AUR packages ship **space-indented** `.SRCINFO`
(e.g. `opera-developer` uses 8 spaces). A tab-anchored regex silently extracts
nothing on those files, so the install check never matches and the anchor never
advances. The column-0 section headers (`pkgbase=`/`pkgname=`) stay anchored —
they are never indented in practice. A package that didn't build/install won't
match → its anchor is left unchanged → next gate re-audits. This means `accept`
is safe to run on **any** helper exit code.

**Verified (sandboxed, isolated root/dbpath/cachedir):** both `yay` v12.6.0 and
`paru` v2.1.0 exit non-zero on ANY build failure (`exit status 4` from makepkg
propagates), `--noconfirm` included, ordering-independent — the good packages
install, the failing one is blocked. **Source-confirmed via deepwiki:** yay
(`Jguer/yay`, `main.go`) mirrors makepkg's `exec.ExitError` or defaults to 1,
`--noconfirm` is orthogonal, no swallow path; paru (`Morganamilo/paru`,
`--failfast` v1.11.0+) returns non-zero if any package fails to build (continues
others, but non-zero), no swallow path. So `rc==0 → accept` alone is safe;
install-confirmation is kept as defense-in-depth against untested code paths or
future helper changes. A sandboxed `-Syu` was not run (only `-Bi`), but the
exit-code semantics are now source-grounded rather than inferred for both
gated helpers.

**Review debate (deepseek-v4-pro/xhigh):** 6 findings raised. Conceded: (2)
review-consent must also stage [fixed — stage before `return 2`]; (3) no staged
GC [fixed — `gc_state` sweeps `staged/` at +7d, `accepted/` never swept]; (5)
empty-diff staging is a no-op [fixed — stage only on non-empty clean/review];
(6) bare SHA lacks provenance [fixed — `sha\tts\turl`]. Disputed finding (1)
"`--all-staged` promotes unbuilt commits" was rated CRITICAL but its premise
("yay can exit 0 on partial") is disproven by the test above; demoted to
non-issue. `--all-staged` was dropped entirely in favor of a per-run manifest
(cross-run isolation) + install-confirmation (intra-run). Finding (4) agreed
the TOCTOU argument validates staging over deferred.

### `comm -13` set-diff for domain drift, not regex
A version bump on the *same* domain (kernel.org → kernel.org) must NOT fire.
Only NEW domains should. A regex can't express "set membership" cleanly;
`comm -13` does. Same logic for `source=()` host drift.

### `.patch` / `.diff` excluded from diff scanning
Legitimate C/C++ patches contain hex/octal escapes and `eval`-like patterns.
Including them would false-positive on most C/C++ AUR packages.

### Missing-cache path: baseline recovery + whole-file fallback
A package in `yay -Qua` whose cache clone is gone (manual `rm`, `yay -Sc`,
corruption, new machine) has no `origin/master` to diff and no accepted ref to
diff against. The entire gate is a `git diff accepted..origin/master`, so v1
`return 0`'d with a dim "skip" — a malicious update sailed through **ungated**
while the gate still printed `✓ all clear`. This is strictly weaker than the
new-install path (`audit`), which at least runs the absolute rules. `check_pkg`
now routes this case to `missing_cache_gate`, a **two-tier** gate:

**Tier 1 — baseline recovery (preferred).** Fresh-clone the AUR repo, then walk
`origin/<branch>` history to find the commit whose `.SRCINFO` matches the
**installed** version (`find_baseline_commit`), and diff
`installed-commit..origin/master` through the SAME `scan_diff_rules` pipeline the
cached path uses (hard + review + structural checks). Exit codes mirror the
cached path: hard hit → 1 (block), review hit → 2, clean → 0. This eliminates
the whole-file false positives that motivated review-only-on-missing-cache: a
pre-existing legit `.install` hook (ventoy-bin's `post_install`) is NOT in the
delta, so only a newly-added hook (the campaign vector) is flagged.

**Tier 2 — whole-file fallback.** If the installed version isn't found in AUR
history (or can't be queried), clone + hard-rules-only absolute scan of
PKGBUILD/`.install`/`.sh` at **review level**: hard hit → 2 (consent), clean →
0. This is the old `scan_clone` behavior, preserved for the no-match case. Clone
failure → 2 (zero signal — surface for consent, never silently pass). The clone
URL is overridable via `AUR_SAFE_AUR_URL` (mirrors + selftest without network).

**`find_baseline_commit` mechanism & policy.** It reads every commit's `.SRCINFO`
in one `git cat-file --batch` pass (~80 ms for an 858-commit repo; per-commit
`git show` is ~25× slower). The batch stream echoes the *blob's* sha in its
header, not the commit's, so the commit↔`.SRCINFO` association is restored by
passing the oldest-first commit list into awk and mapping by block index. It
returns the **OLDEST** matching commit: if several commits share the installed
pkgver (e.g. a malicious push keeping pkgver identical), the oldest match
maximizes diff coverage and surfaces any intervening commit **within retained
AUR history**. Conservative within that history — it may over-report on a benign
re-commit at the same version. Whitespace-tolerant version extraction mirrors
`_installed_matches` (some packages ship space-indented `.SRCINFO`, e.g.
opera-developer).

**Why tier-2 is review (2), not hard-fail (1):** a whole-file scan has no
baseline, so the `install-hook-*` rules fire on any pre-existing legit `.install`
(ventoy-bin, vscode-bin, …). Hard-failing would block routine updates of common
packages. (Tier 1's diff has none of these FPs, so it CAN hard-fail — and does.)
Why not advisory (0) like `audit`: `audit` gates a deliberate *new* install the
user just typed; an uncached *update* is an unsolicited delta the user expected
the gate to have already vouched for. Silent auto-proceed on that path is the
bug we're fixing.

**Staging preserves the finding-1.2 TOCTOU guarantee on both tiers.** `_clone_aur`
captures the gate-time tip (`origin/<branch>` SHA + origin URL) into `SCAN_SHA`
before any cleanup. On a clean or review-hit scan (NOT hard-fail, NOT
clone-failure), `_stage_scan_if_gating` writes `staged/<pkgbase>` + manifest
entry, exactly as the cached path's `_stage_if_gating` does. So `accept` promotes
the **audited** commit X (the origin tip at clone time), not whatever the helper
later fetches+installs (X′) — and NOT the baseline commit (which is only the diff
base, never a trust anchor). Without staging, a window-commit X′ pushed between
the clone and yay's own fetch would install, then be auto-seeded as the trusted
baseline on the next gate (`accepted_ref` falls back to helper-cache HEAD when no
accepted file exists) — reopening the exact bug finding 1.2 closed. Hard-fail
exits do NOT stage: a blocked update never reaches the helper, so there's nothing
to accept. Staging keys by **pkgbase**, derived from the clone dir name
(`${dir##*/}`, mirroring the cached path). `_clone_aur` resolves pkgname→pkgbase
via AUR RPC before cloning (Finding N fix), so split packages stage and anchor
correctly. Flag files stay keyed by pkgname for display (`explain <pkgname>`).

**`scan_diff_rules` is shared by both diff paths** (cached + baseline recovery)
so they can never drift: `diff_added` → hard rules + new-`.install` (→ `hard`,
exit 1 + stash) → review rules + modified-`.install` + added/removed files + new
binaries + maintainer/source drift (→ `review`, exit 2 + stash) → deterministic
boring metadata allowlist (→ `boring`, exit 0) → parser-ambiguous known boring
fields (→ `boring_edge`, exit 2 unless the opt-in strict verifier returns
exactly `VERDICT: BORING_EDGE_OK`). `.SRCINFO` lines that changed only leading
whitespace are ignored before metadata classification (makepkg regeneration can
flip spaces↔tabs without semantic change). Literal `.SRCINFO` advisory/package
metadata entries (`pkgdesc`, `url`, `arch`, `license`, `groups`, `optdepends`,
`noextract` — `noextract=` is a versioned *filename* pointing at a `source=()`
entry, never executed) and `.SRCINFO` dependency entries either already
satisfied by the installed package set, proven by pacman sync DB to be
repository packages, OR **intra-pkgbase** (the dep's name matches this
pkgbase's `pkgbase=` or a declared `pkgname=` member at the new tip — a
self-reference that cannot pull in unaudited code from outside the package
under review) are boring metadata; all other unknown/AUR-looking dependencies
stay review so a package update cannot silently pull an unaudited AUR
dependency. The **PKGBUILD array-literal forms** of `license`/`arch`/`groups`/
`noextract` (`license=('MIT' 'LGPL-2.0-or-later')`, `arch=('x86_64' 'aarch64')`)
are classified symmetrically with their `.SRCINFO` space-delimited forms —
makepkg writes them into `.PKGINFO` without executing them; they touch no
checksum, source host, or trust anchor. (`pkgdesc`/`url` are scalars, never
array literals; `optdepends` keeps its own stricter handler that rejects shell
expansion.) `PKGBUILD` build variables assigned a bare **lowercase** git SHA
(`_commit=<hex>`, `_gittag=<short-sha>`, `_gitrev`/`_tag`/`_rev`, optionally
quoted, 7..40 hex chars) are boring — the RHS of a string assignment is never
executed and the fetched artifact is verified by the `*sums=()` array. The
var-name is RESTRICTED to conventional SHA holders (not any `_`-prefixed var):
this closes the validpgpkeys-indirection gap a delegate review flagged
(delegate-review Finding 1), where a `_evil=<lowercase-40hex>` feeding an
already-present `validpgpkeys=($_evil)` would otherwise auto-clear on a
trust-anchor surface (lowercase is NOT a defense — `validpgpkeys=` accepts any
case; the var-name allowlist is). Add a name to the allowlist only when a real
AUR package needs it — every added name re-opens the surface. **Dotted-decimal
version build-vars** (`_nwjs_ffmpeg_version=0.113.0`, `_electron_version=v25.3.0`
— optional `v` prefix + quotes, any `_-prefixed var name`) are the same
inert-metadata class and are boring: the RHS never executes, and the version only
selects a path in `source=()` whose artifact is verified by `*sums=()` (host drift
/ IDN homograph are caught by `source_domains()` + the Finding E guard, run before
the per-line loop). Unlike `_commit`, the var-name is NOT restricted here — a
dotted decimal cannot be a PGP fingerprint (hex) or a checksum (hex/`SKIP`), so
the RHS **format** is the security boundary, not the name; the validpgpkeys-
indirection that forced the `_commit` allowlist has no analogue. This matters
because real package var names don't follow a convention (`_nwjs_ffmpeg_version`,
not `_version`), so a name allowlist would silently miss the motivating
`opera-developer` case. Command substitution is rejected (`$`/backtick break the
`[0-9.]` match). Inline
fingerprints in `validpgpkeys=(...)` remain caught by
`_pkgbuild_checksum_array_line` (requires a `*sums=(` array). Indexed
checksum-array element assignments (`sha512sums[0]=<hex>` / `'SKIP'` — distinct
syntax from the `sums=(...)` literal and `sums_<arch>=` var forms; the `[N]`
index between name and `=` breaks both of those regexes) are boring: the RHS is
inert data makepkg enforces against the downloaded artifact, and a wrong value
fails the build before install; the motivating `cursor-bin` shape declares the
array with a `'SKIP'` placeholder at `[0]`, then overwrites `[0]` in a separate
statement with the real hash. **Arch-qualified** `source`/`*sums` lines are
classified symmetrically with their bare forms in every syntax:
`.SRCINFO` space-delimited (`source_x86_64 =` / `sha256sums_aarch64 =`),
PKGBUILD single-line arrays (`source_x86_64=(...)`), and bare assignments —
the `opencode-bin` / `visual-studio-code-bin` per-arch-tarball shape (a
version bump renaming each `source_<arch>` URL on the same host is boring).
This is safe only because the **Finding E homograph guard**
(`_source_line_nonascii`, run in `classify_diff_rules` before the per-line
boring loop) forces review on any added line carrying `://` (or a `source`/
`source_*=` token) with a byte ≥ 0x80: `source_domains()`'s hostname extractor
is ASCII-only and blind to IDN homograph hosts, so without the guard a
Cyrillic-prefixed URL would auto-clear as inert metadata (the threat model's
own example). The `://`-anywhere match catches the multi-line array
continuation line shape, not just the `source=` token-start line — added
2026-07-05 after a delegate review flagged that the continuation line
otherwise falls to the standalone-URL `boring_edge` path, reachable by the LLM
auto-green verifier (the LLM is no better at spotting an invisible Cyrillic
byte than the deterministic classifier). Literal
single-quoted `PKGBUILD optdepends=(...)` entries and standalone quoted/bare
`SKIP`/hex tokens — the per-line shape inside a PKGBUILD multiline
`sha256sums=(...)` array, distinct from the `.SRCINFO` `sha256sums = <hex>`
form already handled above — are boring metadata; non-literal PKGBUILD shell
expansion inside optdepends stays review. The optdepends/checksum array-state
trackers (`_pkgbuild_optdepends_added_line`, `_pkgbuild_checksum_array_line`)
recover the enclosing array opener not only from a hunk body line but also
from git's `@@ … @@ <label>` hunk-header context, so a changed element deep in
a large array — where git splits the diff and emits the opener only in the
header label — still classifies correctly. All git invocations are isolated
from user/system config via `export GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null
GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM=/dev/null` at script load (Finding J): user options like
`diff.noprefix` (strips the `b/` prefix → file trackers never match),
`diff.colorWords`/`diff.wordDiff` (word-oriented output, no `+` prefixes →
empty `added`), and `textconv` (arbitrary code on `git show`) would otherwise
break the pipeline or execute attacker code; the export overrides any hostile
caller env (last export wins) and makes diff output deterministic.
**Review-detail selection** (`_detail_is_build_logic` / `_review_added_line_summary`):
when a diff has more than one non-boring added line, the reported detail prefers
a build-logic line (a `prepare`/`build`/`check`/`package`/`install` function
header, or a build/install statement like `install`/`cp`/`cmake`/`make`/`npm`/
`cargo`) over an earlier metadata-ish non-boring line (e.g. `backup=`, a new
PKGBUILD var assignment), so the reviewer's eye lands on the security-relevant
change. This is editorial only — the gate's classification is unaffected; a
missed keyword falls through to the generic summary (fail-safe). The
build-logic check is **content-based**, not git-hunk-annotation-based: PKGBUILD
has no built-in diff driver, so git never annotates hunks with `package()`/
`build()` context, making a prior `^PKGBUILD:N in (...)` summary regex
effectively dead. The keyword list is not a security blacklist (the threat
model's red line is against attacker-rotated package/installer names, not shell
keywords).
Diff/read failures are `audit_unavailable` (exit 2), never LLM auto-green, and
never stage. Staging stays in the callers (cached uses `_stage_if_gating` with a
cache dir; missing-cache uses `_stage_scan_if_gating` with `SCAN_SHA`).

**Optional LLM boring-edge verifier.** Config is loaded from
`~/.config/aur-safe/config` (`KEY=value`, currently only
`AUR_SAFE_LLM_AUTO_BORING=0|1`), with environment variables taking precedence.
When disabled, `boring_edge` is ordinary review. When enabled, `llm_check_boring_edge`
uses `pi` with no tools/session and accepts only an exact first-line
`VERDICT: BORING_EDGE_OK`; command failure, missing `pi`, malformed output,
`NEEDS_HUMAN`, truncation, or anything else returns review. This can stage only
through the normal clean rc-0 caller path, so the staged SHA remains the
gate-time tip and `accept` still requires installed-version confirmation.

**Known limitation — missing-cache baseline recovery trusts retained AUR
history.** The cached path anchors on aur-safe's frozen SHA, but a missing-cache
package has no local accepted/cache ref. Baseline recovery reconstructs a diff
base from the fresh clone's history by matching the installed version string. If
an attacker force-pushes AUR history so the only commit matching the installed
version is at or after a payload commit, that payload is in the reconstructed
baseline and excluded from the diff. The oldest-match policy is conservative
only among commits still visible in the fetched history; it cannot recover
history that was rewritten away. This does NOT affect staging/accept: clean or
review scans still stage only the gate-time tip, and hard/unknown audits still
do not stage.

**Known limitation — `AUR_SAFE_ALLOW_REVIEW=1` auto-proceeds clone failures.**
The wrapper honors this env var for all exit-2 results, including a clone
failure (zero signal). In non-interactive/automation contexts this recreates a
silent-passthrough hole for the missing-cache path specifically. A separate
exit code for "audit unavailable" (not consented review) was considered and
deferred — it requires a wrapper-contract change. For now, do not set
`AUR_SAFE_ALLOW_REVIEW=1` in automation that can't tolerate a blocked update.

**Review debate (glm-5.1 / kimi-k2.6 / qwen3.7-max):** 6 findings raised.
Conceded & fixed: (1) HIGH — TOCTOU/anchor-poisoning via unstaged scan-time tip
[fixed — `_stage_scan_if_gating` + `SCAN_SHA`/`SCAN_URL` capture]; (4) unvalidated
`$pkg` in `check_pkg` (only `cmd_audit` validated) + missing `--` in `git clone`
[fixed — regex guard at `check_pkg` entry, `--` separator]; missing-PKGBUILD
silently accepted if `.install` exists [fixed — explicit PKGBUILD-existence
check]. Noted, deferred: clone-fail under `AUR_SAFE_ALLOW_REVIEW=1` [see limit
above]; restricting the scan to `.install`+`.sh` (not PKGBUILD) to shrink
false-positive blast radius on legit `build()` npm calls [moot for tier 1 —
baseline recovery made the whole-file FP problem largely disappear; tier 2 still
hard-scans PKGBUILD]; a *separate* pre-existing blindspot where `find_pkg_dir`'s
slow path can return a `.SRCINFO`-only dir (no `.git`) → `git rev-parse` fails →
`return 0` [same category, natural follow-up]. Held: `explain` prompt labels
whole-file content as "FLAGGED DIFF" — cosmetic, the LLM analysis is
format-agnostic.

### Cache re-seeding — rejected (baseline recovery superseded it)
A `reseed`/`yay -G` wrapper to restore a missing cache clone was once the
planned "fix" for the missing-cache path. **Rejected after baseline recovery
landed**, on three grounds:
1. **The motivation is gone.** Re-seeding was conceived when missing-cache was a
degraded path (coarse whole-file scan, `.install` FPs). Baseline recovery made
the missing-cache path a real diff through the same `scan_diff_rules` pipeline —
functionally equivalent to the cached path for the common case. Re-seeding no
longer upgrades a bad path to a good one.
2. **It would make the next gate *less* scrutinized, not more.** Cached
first-contact seeds the anchor from clone HEAD and audits *nothing* about the
tip (trusted wholesale). Missing-cache baseline recovery diffs the installed
version to the tip and scans the delta. So restoring the cached path to "fix" a
missing-cache package would reduce scrutiny on its next gate.
3. **Naive re-seed re-creates the blindspot** for the *currently-pending* update:
clone → `accepted_ref` auto-seeds from clone HEAD (= origin/master tip) → if
that update is malicious, the next gate shows an empty diff and prints clean.
This is identical to fresh-install first-contact semantics (an accepted
assumption), so it's not a new hole — but it inverts the value proposition.

The escape hatch for the rare convenience case already exists and is free:
`yay -G <pkg>` clones correctly (incl. split packages, which the missing-cache
clone URL gets wrong) and behaves as a known first-contact seed. Document, don't
build. Revisit only if repeated fresh-clone cost on missing-cache packages
becomes measurable (unlikely — missing-cache is rare and one clone per gate is
~80ms).

### Exit codes: 0 clean | 1 hard-fail | 2 review | 3 usage/env
Maps cleanly to wrapper semantics: 0 → proceed, 1 → abort, 2 → proceed with
consent, 3 → surface error. More granular codes would just need re-mapping
at the wrapper layer.

### Written in bash, not Go
It's a security tool; every line should be eyeballable by the user. The logic
is git + grep + exec, all safe and idiomatic in bash. Port to Go if it grows
complexity beyond what bash reads cleanly.

### Backticks in single-quoted regex/test strings (shellcheck SC2016)
The backticks are *characters to match*, not command substitution. Switching
to double quotes (as shellcheck suggests) would make bash execute
`` `curl -s http://x` `` during the self-test. Single quotes are mandatory
here. SC2016 is correct about the mechanics, wrong about the implication.

### `sed 's/^/  /'` for indenting output (shellcheck SC2001)
For prefixing every line of a multi-line string, `sed` is more readable than
the `${var//$'\n'/...}` equivalent. The subprocess-perf argument is irrelevant
outside a hot loop, and this isn't one.

## Open pressure points — useful feedback belongs here

These are the real pressure points where future work should stay focused:

1. **Hard-fail vs review classification.** Currently `npm`/`pnpm`/`bun`/`yarn`
   in a PKGBUILD diff are hard-fails; `pip`/`gem`/`cargo`/`go install` are
   review-only. The asymmetry is intentional (the observed campaign uses JS
   package managers; Python/Ruby/etc. legit use is more common in AUR), but
   the line is a judgment call. Is it drawn in the right place?

2. **Hex/octal run threshold = 2+.** Somewhat arbitrary. 2 catches
   `\x6e\x70` (two chars) but also `\x1b\x5d` (legit OSC sequences in some
   terminal scripts). 3+ would reduce FPs but miss short obfuscated strings.
   Is 2 right?

3. **New installs (`yay -S foo`) are advisory, not gating.** No baseline to
   diff against, so only absolute rules apply — and blocking on "any npm call
   in a PKGBUILD" would block legit node-related AUR packages. Currently
   prints findings and proceeds. Should it gate instead?

4. **Wrapper defines both `yay()` and `paru()`.** (Resolved — both are gated
   cross-shell, bash+zsh.) Residual: `_aur_safe_dispatch` itself is only tested
   via the classify function, not end-to-end. The 3 historical dispatch bugs
   were each found manually, not by selftest. Trust the classify tests; verify
   the full pipeline manually on any wrapper change.

5. **Missing-cache baseline recovery is weaker than a frozen accepted SHA.**
   It is a real diff path for retained history, but force-pushed-away history
   cannot be reconstructed from a fresh clone. Should this narrow path escalate
   to mandatory review, or is the current documented limitation acceptable for
   the rare missing-cache case?

## Path forward (current priorities)

The core update gate is the protected asset: cached updates, missing-cache
baseline recovery, staging/accept, and diff-failure handling now share the same
diff-based trust discipline. Future work should improve that discipline or
remove drift; it should not broaden the trust path casually.

1. **Split "audit unavailable" from "review hit".** Clone/diff failures have
   zero signal and should not be auto-consented by `AUR_SAFE_ALLOW_REVIEW=1`.
   The smallest safe contract change is a separate wrapper result for audit
   unavailable; `AUR_SAFE_ALLOW_REVIEW=1` should apply only to real rule hits.
2. ~~**Add a review-level homograph check for `source=()` URLs.**~~ ✅ done
   2026-07-01 (`_source_line_nonascii`). Flag newly-added or changed source
   hostnames containing non-ASCII characters (bytes ≥ 0x80) → review, before
   the per-line boring loop. Covers `.SRCINFO` space-delimited + PKGBUILD array
   + bare assignment syntaxes. Hard-fail upgrade still open pending real
   campaign evidence.
3. **Decide the missing-cache history-rewrite policy.** Baseline recovery is
   precise when the installed version still exists in fetched history, but the
   attacker-controlled repo can erase earlier commits. Consider whether this
   should stay documented, force review, or get a stronger external baseline.
4. **Measure before changing new-install gating or thresholds.** Keep `audit`
   advisory until real AUR samples quantify false positives. Any move toward
   blocking new installs, changing the hex/octal threshold, or reclassifying
   package managers needs fixtures that prove the false-positive cost is worth
   the added protection.

Definition of done for trust-path changes: update this ledger, link code
comments to the relevant section/finding, run `bash -n aur-safe`,
`./aur-safe selftest`, and `shellcheck -s bash aur-safe`, and re-check the
TOCTOU invariant: blocked/unknown audits never stage; clean/review audits stage
only the gate-time tip; `accept` promotes only installed-version-confirmed
staged commits.

## What I don't need feedback on

- "Why not just use an LLM?" — see Architecture. Settled.
- "Why bash not Go/Rust/Python?" — see Decisions. Settled for v1.
- Style nits that shellcheck already flagged and I deliberately kept
  (SC2016, SC2001). See Decisions.
- Suggestions to add more package names to a blacklist. The whole point is
  that blacklists lose.

## Verification status (so you don't re-verify what's already proven)

- `selftest`: 182/182 (47 rule-engine cases, including flag-bearing JS package
  managers, combined `-c` interpreter flags, fetch-file-exec, OpenSSL base64,

  accepted-ref / staging / accept / install-confirmation, incl. faithful split +

  +46 classifier/LLM cases covering boring
  version/checksum/same-host source passes, `.SRCINFO` leading-whitespace-only
  regeneration, multiline checksum passes, literal `.SRCINFO` advisory metadata
  (incl. `noextract=`), PKGBUILD advisory-array literals (`license`/`arch`/
  `groups`/`noextract` `=(...)`), repo/satisfied/**intra-pkgbase** dependency
  metadata, and `PKGBUILD` optdepends metadata passes,
  unknown dependency review, non-literal optdepends shell-expansion review,
  optdepends-plus-prepare review, source-host drift review, source-non-ASCII
  homograph review (Finding E, `.SRCINFO` + PKGBUILD single-line array + bare
  forms AND the multi-line `source=(\n  <url>\n)` continuation-line form a
  delegate review caught as a residual reaching `boring_edge`),
  arch-qualified `source_<arch>` boring pass (opencode-bin/vscode-bin shape),
  multiline-source boring-edge review, build logic review, hard-pattern block,
  a package-body-changes-with-license-array review (the kilo-bin shape — gate
  still blocks when license=() is boring but a new install line is not), the
  first review-detail-selection assertion (the reported detail points at the
  build-logic line, summary is "package build instructions changed"), a
  colon-in-text regression (build-logic detection on added text containing
  `": "` — pins the raw-text path that replaced the broken `${detail##*: }`
  extraction a delegate review caught),
  audit-unavailable no-LLM, disabled verifier no-call, exact OK auto-pass,
  NEEDS_HUMAN/malformed/failure/missing-`pi` review, and LLM auto-green staging
  of the gate-time tip; deep-in-multi-hunk-array checksum/optdepends passes
  (hunk-header opener recovery), `_commit=<hex>` build-var passes (unquoted /
  single / double quoted), command-substitution review, an arbitrary-`_var`
  validpgpkeys-indirection review (var-name restriction, delegate-review
  Finding 1), an intra-pkgbase dep-on-newly-added-member review (new member
  section is itself a review signal), and indexed checksum-array element
  assignment passes (`sha512sums[0]=<hex>`/`SKIP`, command-subst review); +8 split-package missing-cache cases (Finding N):

  no-resolution-clonefail; +4 RPC pkgbase-parser cases pinned against AUR
  JSON fixtures: split-resolves / nonsplit-resolves / notfound-returns-1 /
  name-mismatch-returns-1). Live end-to-end confirmed against real AUR for
  `opencl-nvidia-580xx` / `nvidia-580xx-dkms` (split members of
  `nvidia-580xx-utils`): resolve pkgbase → clone → baseline-recovery diff.
  Run with `aur-safe selftest`.
- Accepted-ref lifecycle verified end-to-end on a real cached package
  (cursor-bin): seed from HEAD, stage on non-empty clean diff, manifest write,
  install-confirmation (incl. non-split `pkgbase=` fallback), `accept` promotion.
- Wrapper dispatch (gate → build → `accept`) verified with a stub helper in
  both bash and zsh: clean build → accept → rc 0; failed build → rc 1
  propagated; review-consent → proceeds → rc 0.
- `yay`/`paru` exit non-zero on ANY build failure — sandboxed test
  (isolated root/dbpath/cachedir, good+broken PKGBUILDs), both helpers,
  ordering-independent. **Source-confirmed via deepwiki** for both `Jguer/yay`
  (`main.go`, mirrors `exec.ExitError`) and `Morganamilo/paru` (`--failfast`,
  non-zero if any build fails). See *Accepted-ref state* above.
- Full cached-package sweep (18 packages, all installed AUR pkgs on this
  system): install-confirmation parser verdict matches the ground-truth oracle
  (MATCH iff installed version == parsed `.SRCINFO` version) on every row —
  tab-format, space-format (opera-developer), split (windsurf), and stale-cache
  cases alike. No false positives or negatives.
- Real AUR updates: clean, exit 0, no regression.
- Missing-cache path verified live on ventoy-bin (cache clone deleted,
  pending update): v1 silently `return 0`'d; now clones and baseline-recovers
  (installed version matched in AUR history → real diff), so the pre-existing
  legit `.install` hook no longer false-positives — exits 0 when the delta is
  clean, 1 if a hook is newly added. Falls back to whole-file review (2) only
  if the installed version isn't in history. Scan stashed for `explain`.
- `find_baseline_commit` validated against real caches (opencode-bin 858
  commits, opera-developer 421 incl. space-indented `.SRCINFO`, cursor-bin,
  vscode-bin): correct commit, correct ancestor-of-origin/master, correct
  version match, ~80 ms history walk for the largest repo. The missing-.SRCINFO
  block-index path is covered by `baseline-skips-missing-srcinfo` (a mid-history
  commit without `.SRCINFO` no longer desyncs the cat-file batch walk).
- Synthetic full-evasion attack: hard rules fire, exit 1.
- Stealth scenario (impersonation + modified hook + committed binary, no
  payloads): review rules fire, exit 2.
- `explain` → LLM path confirmed working with glm-5.2.
- Wired cross-shell (`~/.shrc`), both `yay` and `paru` gated.
- **Red-team review (2026-06-26):** three delegate reviewers (glm-5.1 adversarial
  auditor, kimi-k2.6 edge-case hunter, qwen3.7-max bug spotter) against the full
  codebase + docs — 23 findings across 14 new finding files (E–R) + 9 low-severity
  items. Two critical (E: IDN homograph silent bypass; F: .SRCINFO trust-anchor
  poisoning), six high (G: tier-2 review-rules skipped; H: bunx/pnpm exec/yarn
  dlx missing; I: pip3 bypass; J: git-config breaks diff; K: epoch=0; L:
  manifest race). See [BACKLOG.md](../../BACKLOG.md) for prioritized task list
  and [docs/findings/](docs/findings/) for individual write-ups.
